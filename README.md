# Star-Wars-Training-Droid

So, you want to build an autonoumous drone to train yourself in the ways of the force?

Have fun. Alot about this repo is highly specific. The SBUS library is a bit more versatile, but even then theres alot of gunk in there that only works for my unique application
Read the code, understand it, ask questions, and get ready for a long project. 

But also HAVE FUN YOU'RE LEARNING HOW TO BECOME A JEDI

blood, sweat, and tears


The SBUS library was based on the c++ library written by Bolderflight: https://github.com/bolderflight/SBUS
It was also very handy to reference this breakdown of FrSky SBUS in making the library: https://os.mbed.com/users/Digixx/notebook/futaba-s-bus-controlled-by-mbed/

The Lidar library was taken from Adafruit: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_LIDARLite
The ZED code was taken from their tutorials: https://github.com/stereolabs/zed-examples

The Navigates file was written by Benjamin Macdonell for use in this project, it handles the PID loop

This repo requires multiprocessing, cython, numpy, open cv, servokit, and lots else
